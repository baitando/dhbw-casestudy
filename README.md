# Purpose

This is a demo project which is used to accompany the lecture software engineering at DHBW Villingen-Schwenningen.

1. The code provided in the master branch is the starting point for getting familiar with code analysis. The code quality is deliberately bad. The students will have to identify bad style etc. in this part.
2. The next exercise is to do a refactoring with the purpose of improving the code quality. This includes restructuring, exception handling, logging, documentation, use of patterns etc. A possible result of this is provided in a separate branch.
3. Afterwards the focus switches to developer tests. Students should provide simple tests to ensure the correct behavior of the code. A possible result of this is provided in a separate branch.
